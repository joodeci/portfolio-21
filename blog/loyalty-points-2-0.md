Case study coming soon. This is a place holder section for where the case study will live. [Follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/joodeci) to be updated when my case study goes live!

## "Case study coming soon... I promise"

This is where a second paragraph would live. I'm going to use place holders for the remaining sections of this page so that I could test things out :). Thanks for stopping by and reading.

Girl you know we belong together. I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this. You'll be mine forever baby. You just wait. We belong together. And you know that I am right. Why do you play with my heart? Why do you play with my mind? Said we'd be forever. Said it'd never die. How could you love me and leave me and never. Say goodbye?
